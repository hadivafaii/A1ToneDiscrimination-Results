Section 1
=======================

This phase was about looking at individual experiments

## Content:

### Classification analysis
We defined binary classification tasks and explored whether there is information in neural code during pure listening period that is predictive of behavior that will occur next.

### Linear discriminant analysis (LDA):
We explore a lower dimensional projection of the data and observe that such structure exists in data.  Different trial types have different characteristics that can be captured in a lower dimensional space using LDA analysis.  This structrue exists for individual experiments separately but we do not know if this can be seen globally.  This will be the subject of next section
